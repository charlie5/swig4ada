SWIG Examples

The "perl5", "python", "tcl", "guile", "java", "mzscheme", "ruby", and
"chicken" directories contain a number of simple examples that are
primarily used for testing. The "GIFPlot" directory contains a more
complicated example that illustrates some of SWIG's more advanced
capabilities.

The file 'index.html' is the top of a hyperlinked document that
contains information about all of the examples along with various
notes related to each example.

The Examples directory is currently quite incomplete because it
is being reorganized.  A more complete set of examples can be found
in the SWIG1.1p5 distribution (most of which should still work with
SWIG1.3).

Note: All of the examples rely upon the Makefile in this directory.
You may need to edit it to reflect the configuration of your machine
in case the configure script guesses incorrect settings.


*** Special note concering C++ ***

The configure script is currently unable to handle all of the possible
options for producing dynamically loadable C++ extensions.  Here are
the rules of thumb for making C++ work:

 -  Try using the C++ as the linker for the shared library.  For example:

         g++ -shared $(OBJS) -o module.so

 -  If that doesn't work, you may need to explicitly link against some
    kind of C++ runtime library.  For example:

         ld -G $(OBJS) -L/opt/SUNWspro/lib -lCrun -o module.so

    This can be set by modifying the setting of CPP_DLLIBS in the
    Makefile.


*** Special note for SWIG Maintainers ***

When you add an example, consider arranging for the example to be also
useful as part of the SWIG testing framework.  To do this, include in
the example makefile a target "check" ("check: all" is sufficient for a
first pass), and add an invocation to ../Makefile.in under target
"check-examples" (or whatever is appropriate).  Later, we can add or
expand the actions under target "check" to do more in-depth testing.
