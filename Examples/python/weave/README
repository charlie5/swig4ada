This directory contains a simple example to test weave support for
SWIG wrapped objects.

The weave package provides tools for including C/C++ code in Python
code. This offers both another level of optimization to those who need
it, and an easy way to modify and extend any supported extension
libraries.  Weave automatically builds an extension module from the
given C/C++ code and runs that.  This can result in very significant
speedups (of upto 500x) depending on the problem.  Weave also supports
inlining SWIG-1.3.x wrapped objects.

The example in this directory requires that weave be installed.  Weave
is distributed as part of SciPy (http://www.scipy.org).  More
information on Weave may be had from here:

As of November 22, 2004, this example only works with weave from CVS.
If there is a more recent release of SciPy after this date, it should
work fine.


Also, you need to replace the weave file swigptr2.py by the one
provided here.
